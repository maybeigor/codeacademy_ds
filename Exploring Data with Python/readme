Data Set : https://openrepair.org/

Using Python, we’ll answer data questions like:

    what kinds of products are brought to these events?
    how often are these products actually fixed?
    are more or fewer products being brought to these events over time?

We’ve loaded the first few rows of the dataset in the Learning Environment to the right. Each row, or record, corresponds to a single product brought to a repair club event.

For example, the third row of the dataset indicates that a 2015 Apple phone was brought to a repair club event in Sweden in 2018. While the phone was judged repairable, according to the data it was not fixed at the event.
